Introduction

Introduction 
Pagirinya Refugee Settlement in northern Uganda hosts a significant number of displaced youth who face unique social challenges. 
These challenges often stem from limited educational 
opportunities, economic hardships, and the psychological impact of displacement. At the same time, community networks and support systems 
within the settlement offer potential pathways 
for resilience and growth.  

In this essay, we will explore the primary social issues affecting refugee youth in Pagirinyaâ€”such as inadequate access to education, economic 
instability, mental health struggles, 
and cultural integration difficulties. We will also discuss practical strategies and community-driven initiatives that can help these young 
people overcome adversity and build a brighter 
future. By highlighting success stories and realistic solutions, we aim to show how collective effort can create lasting positive change for 
refugee youth.
